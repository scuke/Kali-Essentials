    Essentials of Kali Linux
    
  Kali Linux has to be one of the most important tools in cyber security. It is a penetration tester's best friend. It is an operating system optimized with many different
  
tools often used for penetration testing. These tools include but aren't limited to Nmap, Nikto, Metasploit, Nessus, and OpenVAS, these are some of the most popular network 

scanning and vulnerability scanning tools.

More in-depth about Kali Linux. It is an open-source tool used for security auditing and penetration testing. Kali Linux comes preinstalled with many tools but if those are 

different from what you need the community is constantly developing new ones all of the time that can be installed using a command line. These tools are targeted towards 

cybersecurity they can be used for forensics. Kali.org goes much more in-depth about what tools are available and what they do.

Penetration testers use Kali as their main tool. Inside of Kali nmap is used to scan networks for open ports. This is a crucial step generally when testing. If a scan is 

successful a tester will pick an open port and research for an exploit. If they can continue they will then use Metasploit, a framework designed to run exploits and deliver 

payloads. This only works with known vulnerabilities Finding your own is a lot harder and requires a different set of skills like scripting for  Testers have to obey the law 

and stay within the given scope. Once a test is complete they have to write a comprehensive report on their findings. The report must be well written so people with 

different levels of technical skills can understand it. 

  An in-depth look at these Kali Linux tools. Some popular vulnerability scanners are Nikto or Nessus however, both differ from each other. Nikto is used for web servers 
  
while Nessus is used for software. Another tool to add to the list is OpenVAS, This is an open-source tool. Vulnerability scanners are automated scanners that look at web 

applications or servers from the outside. They scan ports and networks too. These tools are used for the defensive side of things because this tool helps them look at their 

systems and identify vulnerabilities for the security team to fix. According to Bablix.com "A vulnerability scanner is an application that identifies and creates an 

inventory of all systems connected to a network."

  These are all just a few of the tools used in Kali Linux. Kali is a vital operating system with installed tools or scripts that you can use for a penetration test or what 
  
hackers use. This is a rough view of what a day in the life of a pentester looks like and the tools they use. Pen testing is used for good to help fortify systems. Using 

these tools is a great way to do so.
